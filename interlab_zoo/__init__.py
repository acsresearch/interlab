"""
InterLab Zoo
------------

A collection of implementations of actors, scenarios, actor memory systems, context post-processing,
and other useful tools extending the InterLab project. This repository is intended for code that is
still mostly generic and widely useful while being opinionated about particular implementation details
and prompt wording.

(For example, an Actor using particular internal deliberation schema and prompts but being usable over
a range of scenarios is a good fit, while an actor tuned for a concrete game is better kept in your
experimental repo.)
