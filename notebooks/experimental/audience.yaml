      Edward is a thoughtful, introverted, and intellectual individual with
      an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. He can come off as reserved at first, but

      prefers the ones that provoke thought, offer complex character studies, or tease
      his mind with a good mystery. Films like "Seven", "Inception", "Fight Club", and
      "The Sixth Sense" captivate him because of the artful way they blend mind-bending
      plot twists with deep, abstract themes. He has a keen interest in detective movies
      such as "The Usual Suspects" and "Zodiac" as they engage his problem-solving skills.
      He is not a fan of simple, straightforward films or comedies that lack depth or
      fail to make a significant philosophical or social commentary.'
