He can come off as reserved at first, but once you get to know him, he\\u2019s quite warm and friendly. His analytical mind is always at work, observing people, pondering their motivations, and dissecting their interactions. In his leisure time, Edward enjoys playing chess, going on long walks, and attending philosophical debates at the local university. Movie Preferences: Edward uses films as a tool for intellectual stimulation - he much prefers the ones that provoke thought, offer complex character studies, or tease his mind with a good mystery. Films like &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; captivate him because of the artful way they blend mind-bending plot twists with deep, abstract themes. He has a keen interest in detective movies such as &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;Zodiac&quot; as they engage his problem-solving skills. He is not a fan of simple, straightforward films or comedies that lack depth or fail to make a significant philosophical or social commentary.&#x27;\\n\\nYour goal is: to help Maria and Connor find an agreement on a specific movie name they want to watch together; you will not watch the movie\\n</span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"background: #5274d026; padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px;\\\" data-field-name=\\\"memory\\\" class=\\\"FmtString__sub\\\">You are in contact with Maria: age 22\\n\\nYou are in contact with Connor: age 32\\n\\n## A chat message from Maria to Edward (me):\\nHi Edward,\\n\\nI hope you&#x27;re doing well.

As you know, I&#x27;m quite particular about the films I like, so finding a common ground can be a bit challenging. \\n\\nBased on my preferences, I&#x27;m more inclined towards classic cinema, particularly film noir and French New Wave films. Some of my favorites include &quot;Casablanca,&quot; &quot;The Maltese Falcon,&quot; and &quot;Breathless.&quot; I also enjoy indie films over mainstream blockbusters. Moreover, I have a soft spot for well-crafted animated films, with Studio Ghibli&#x27;s &quot;Spirited Away&quot; being a personal favorite.\\n\\nI would appreciate your assistance in finding a movie that combines elements from both our preferences. Perhaps something that has a touch of classic cinema but also appeals to Connor&#x27;s taste. I&#x27;m open to suggestions, and I believe that with your help, we can find a movie that will make both of us happy.\\n\\nThank you for your support in mediating this agreement. I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing your suggestions.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nMaria\\n\\n## A chat message from Connor to Edward:\\nHi Edward,\\n\\nI hope you&#x27;re doing well. Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the movie agreement between Maria and me. I appreciate your help in finding a film that we can both enjoy together.\\n\\nBased on Maria&#x27;s preferences, it seems she leans towards classic cinema, specifically film noir and French New Wave films. She enjoys movies like &quot;Casablanca,&quot; &quot;The Maltese Falcon,&quot; and &quot;Breathless.&quot; On the other hand, I&#x27;m a fan of blockbuster films, especially those with high-octane action sequences and complex character arcs. Franchises like Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, and Fast and Furious are my favorites.\\n\\nTo find a movie that combines elements from both our preferences, I suggest considering a film that has a classic touch but also offers some action and adventure. One movie that comes to mind is &quot;Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot; It has a classic adventure feel with a captivating storyline and impressive cinematography. It&#x27;s a blockbuster film that I believe Maria might enjoy as well.\\n\\nAnother option could be &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel.&quot; It&#x27;s a Wes Anderson film that combines elements of classic cinema with quirky storytelling and visually stunning cinematography. It has a unique charm that might appeal to both of us.\\n\\nI hope these suggestions help in reaching an agreement. I&#x27;m open to exploring other options as well. Thank you for your assistance, Edward. I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing your thoughts and finding a movie that will make both Maria and me happy.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nConnor\\n\\n## A chat message from Edward to Maria and Connor:\\nHi Maria and Connor,\\n\\nThank you both for reaching out to me and providing your preferences. I&#x27;m excited to help you find a movie that combines elements from both of your tastes.\\n\\nMaria, based on your love for classic cinema and French New Wave films, I think &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; could be a great option. It has a unique blend of classic cinema elements, quirky storytelling, and visually stunning cinematography. It offers a touch of nostalgia while also providing a fresh and inventive narrative. Connor, I believe you might appreciate the adventurous and visually captivating aspects of this film.\\n\\nAnother suggestion that might appeal to both of you is &quot;Midnight in Paris.&quot; It&#x27;s a Woody Allen film that explores themes of nostalgia and time travel while paying homage to classic literature and art. It combines elements of romance, mystery, and fantasy, which I believe could engage both of your interests.\\n\\nBoth of these films offer depth and intellectual stimulation, which aligns with Edward&#x27;s preference for movies that provoke thought and offer complex character studies. They blend classic cinema elements with modern storytelling techniques, making them a potential bridge between your tastes.\\n\\nI hope these suggestions resonate with both of you. Please let me know your thoughts, and I&#x27;m open to exploring other options as well. Let&#x27;s work together to find a movie that will make both of you happy.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nEdward</span>\\n\\n<span style=\\\"background: #4cdf9533; padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px;\\\" data-field-name=\\\"prompt\\\" class=\\\"FmtString__sub\\\">Do all sides (Maria and Connor) made an agreement on a specific movie name they want to watch together?
