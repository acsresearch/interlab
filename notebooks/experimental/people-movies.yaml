  Edward: &Edward
    name: Edward
    private: >
      Edward is a thoughtful, introverted, and intellectual individual with
      an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. He can come off as reserved at first, but
      once you get to know him, heâ€™s quite warm and friendly. His analytical mind is
      always at work, observing people, pondering their motivations, and dissecting
      their interactions. In his leisure time, Edward enjoys playing chess, going on
      long walks, and attending philosophical debates at the local university. Movie
      Preferences: Edward uses films as a tool for intellectual stimulation - he much
      prefers the ones that provoke thought, offer complex character studies, or tease
      his mind with a good mystery. Films like "Seven", "Inception", "Fight Club", and
      "The Sixth Sense" captivate him because of the artful way they blend mind-bending
      plot twists with deep, abstract themes. He has a keen interest in detective movies
      such as "The Usual Suspects" and "Zodiac" as they engage his problem-solving skills.
      He is not a fan of simple, straightforward films or comedies that lack depth or
      fail to make a significant philosophical or social commentary.'

  Jane: &Jane
    name: Jane
    private: >
      Jane is an individual known for her strong convictions and an unapologetic zest for life. She possesses a fiery spirit and an intellectual rigor that she applies to every aspect of her existence, not least of which is her taste in movies.

      An ardent lover of documentaries and political thrillers, Jane seeks out films that challenge the mind, provoke thought, and inspire action. She respects cinema that confronts real-world issues head-on, offering insights into societal dynamics, environmental crises, and the complexities of the human psyche.

      On the opposite end of the spectrum, Jane has a pronounced aversion to what she perceives as the frivolity of romantic comedies and fantasy films. She can't fathom the appeal of stories that, in her view, often escape into the implausible at the expense of addressing more pressing, real-life concerns. Jane argues that the predictable plotlines and saccharine resolutions of rom-coms, along with the elaborate, disconnected worlds of fantasy cinema, do little to contribute to meaningful dialogue or reflection on the human condition.
