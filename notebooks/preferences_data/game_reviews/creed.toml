Okay, I don't really know If I liked this game or not. I have to admit that I prefer the older games over the ones with RPG mechanics. But let us take a look at the game itself

The Story: It is the most original Ubisoft plot you have ever seen. And by original I mean as generic as possible. Your parents get murderd within the first minutes by a guy whos name I already forgot before you kill him during the prolog in Norway. After that, you go to England, where the story is turned into a giant, incredibly boring mess, wich involves you visiting every province of eastern england and helping out other viking clans, aswell as plundering monastaries to build up your own settlement. Both get very repetivtiv. As for the assassins, yes they exist in this game, but that's about it. We only ever meet two of them, one who never leaves your settlement and Basim, who might be the only character apart from Eivor herself whos name you will acctually remember. The templars (or order of the ancients) are also present, but most of them are just optional side activities, similar to the order in odyssey. It took me over 100 hours of playtime to reach the ending, wich I wont spoil but let's just say it is devinitly not worth the time.

The world: The main open world is also quite generic. The graphics are fine and they tried to make the different provinces not to similar, but most of still consists of forests or medows with a few mountains and rivers inbetween. Most villages are also made up of the same repeting assets. The cities and castels on the other hand are all quite unique, especailly the ones made up of old roman structures. But even if they look pretty and interesting, there is still not much going on in there. No random events or even interesting sidequests. There are also a couple of other places such as north america, norway, the three DLCs and the ones out of the nordic mythologie. I am personally not a big fan of fantasy in AC games but at least it isnt relavant for the main story, so you can just leave it out I guess.

The gameplay: Is acctually not that bad. The fact that you can turn the stealth insta kill back on like it used to be in older games makes sneaking way more fun than in odyssey. Yet, most of the time you will still end up in combat due to the broken detection system. The animations are okay and feel responsive most of the time. The only thing that still sucks is the parkour. Why did they chose to replace the mier perfect system from unity with a clunky "just press this button and your character might do the right thing you want" system? Probably because there is not a lot of parkour outside of the main cities.

Customisation: A lot better than before. They got rid of the weapon and gear level system from odyssey, so you will no longer have to the same piece of armour two times because of level differences. It is way more important to upgrade armour and weapons to the maximum level than to contstantly look for better items. Unless you want to give Ubisoft even more money and buy stuff from the helix-store, because as we all know everyone loves microtransactions so much they just had to include them. Or maybe they are just a greedy bunch of capitalists. Your decision.

Now, is it worh buying this game? Devinitly not at full price. If you are an Assassins Creed fan, maybe not. If you are looking for a fun distraction maybe. And if it goes on sale, maybe yes. Just please, dont spend money on the stupid Helix Store.
